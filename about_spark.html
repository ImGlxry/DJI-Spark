                    <p>Although their 4 highlighting features are considered to be people's main use there are more features that you could find useful these features help with passing your creativity limits as they enhance the quality of your videos.</p>
                    <h3 class="HeadingBolt">1.Quickshot</h3>
                    <p>QuickShot is a recording feature that allows you to select a flight pattern that you would like your drone to shoot from. This feature allows more clean and cinematic videos due to its smooth movement and transitions. QuickShot comes with different shooting modes which are the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rocket: This is a down view shot where the drone concentrates on an object while ascending.</li>
                            <li>Dronie: This is when the drone zooms out by flying backwards and ascending while the camera is focused on an object.</li>
                            <li>Circle: With this mode, you will be able to fly the drone around an object which you'll need to select.</li>
                            <li>Helix: The helix mode makes the drone spiral around the selected shot. It first starts of by ascending from it starting point and then executing its task.</li>
                            <li>Boomerang: Boomerang adds a more exaggerated video effect as it moves in an oval figure around the object it's concentrating on while ascending, and flying away from its starting point and descending back to its starting point.</li>
                            <li>Asteroid is useful when it comes to taking photos from far distances. This drone will be capable of "quick-shotting" pictures from different ranges to give a zoom-in/out type of effect.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">2.Tapfly</h3>
                        <p>Tapfly is a go-to feature when it comes to navigating the drone with just 1 tap this feature comes with two settings one being the main which is “coordinate mode” and the other being the direction mode.</p>
                        <p class="HeadingBolt">The coordinate mode allows you to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Select a location you want the drone to fly to and then press go. This will automatically get the drone moving straight to the chosen area point. You can also tap a different location on the go to change directions this will make it navigate to the newly selected location.</li>
                            <li>Control the gimbal pitch to change the viewpoint of the drone whilst on flight. This can be done by dragging your finger up, down, left or right on the screen or by enabling the gimbal bit tracking which requires you to move your phone to change the gimbal's viewpoint (gimbal tracking isn't available for Remote Controller).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="HeadingBolt">The direction mode allows you to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tap the direction you want the drone to fly to and then press go. This will make the drone not stop at a specific location but make it fly straight in the direction you've selected.</li>
                            <li>Change where it's heading mid-flight, this is done by tracing the direction on screen by dragging your finger left or right. Or using your controller's joystick to change where it is heading from left to right or vice versa.</li>  
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">3.Gesture&nbsp;Control</h3>
                        <p>Spark's Deep learning gesture recognition allows you to navigate, and take videos and photos with just simple hand gestures and motions. Gesture control is supported by a mode called Palm Control which allows you to control, and start the drone by hand. If you wish to get access to this you'll need to go to the navigation settings in their DJI GO 4 app (The app used to control the drone remotely) and enable the option from there as shown below.</p>
                        <img class="centerImg Go4Img" src="images/DJI-GO-4-app.jpg" alt="Dji go 4 app image" >
                        <p class="HeadingBolt">With this feature enabled, you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Startup the drone with face recognition</li>
                            <li>Control spark's movement using your palm.</li>
                            <li>Take a selfie by making a frame gesture using your fingers.</li>
                            <li>End the flight by facing your palm upwards just in front and below the drone so that it will land on your palm and turn off.</li>  
                        </ul>

                    <p>The spark drone comes with a wide range of benefits that could be deemed beneficial for your needs, but it also comes with some disadvantages that make it seem unapproachable such as it's price and what you will get from it. Its pros and cons are listed below.</p>
                    <div id="List">
                        <div class="list1">
                            <h3 class="HeadingBolt">Pros</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Portable: It is extremely small and can easily be carried around anywhere</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The speed and range are limited when using a phone to control the drone.</li>
                                <li>Low frame rate captures which can't get up to 24fps.</li>
                                <li>Video resolution can't get any higher than 1080p.</li>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">1. Pricing</h3>
                        <p>As stated in DJI's pros list, the price of this drone is very affordable with a starting price of £519. It is seen as DJI's cheapest drone to exist. Comparing this drone with any other drone within the same price range e.g. Parrot Bebop 2 and Yuneec 4K this drone could be seen more approachable as it has similar and more features.</p>
                        <p>However, this might not be worth buying if you insist on using it with a controller. The controller alone comes separately with a price of £159 which sets its overall price to £678 this might be a bit pricy but even so it's not necessary as the mobile app allows the same and if not more controls than the remote does on its own. However, if you use the mobile app and the drone is at a far distance there is a possibility of it facing connection issues which in this case a controller needs to be considered.</p>
                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">2. portability</h3>
                        <p>The spark drone is extremely portable as it comes in a size of 143 x 143 x 55mm. With these dimensions, you will be able to easily fit this drone into your bag and as it weighs around 900g it won't put any stress on your shoulders. This is extremely useful when it comes to travelling on long journeys. Additionally, it comes with a case where you will be able to store additional propellers and batteries for replacements.</p>
                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">3. Front and downfacing technology</h3>
                        <p>The drone comes with many sensors, all being useful when it comes to keeping it intact, navigational, and safe to use within environments, for example, collision detection. This sensor is a front-facing technology that detects objects in its way to avoid them. But since it's a front-facing sensor it won't sense any danger from behind therefore it is considerate to keep this in mind especially when it comes to using some of its features (e.g. quick shots).</p>
                        <p>In terms of downfacing technology, the drone comes with a navigation system known as a GPS (Global Positioning System) which allows the drone to navigate into any direction, and it comes with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) that helps to inform the user where it's heading to on its screen. With these connections, it encourages precise movement and accurate depictions on where it's heading to and is located.</p>
                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">4. Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>With these verdicts, it can be concluded that the DJI Spark drone is approachable due to its control features, portability, system technology and lastly its affordability being necessary and useful in many conditions. However, there are still a few flaws to it such as not being able to smoothly control the drone without its remote control and not it not being safe to be around especially while using gesture control as it lacks any back-facing technology to sense danger from behind. But even so, it is still worth getting as their extensive variety of features outweighs these traits.</p>

                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">1. License and Registration</h3>
                        <p>Since the spark drone weighs around 250-500g you are required to have a Flyers ID to be able to fly the drone legally. A flyer ID is a license used to identify that the user is skilled in using the drone and can legally and safely fly it around. Not having one could get you fined for breaking this law. To apply you will need to be at least 13 years of age but even so, it is requested to be at least 15 to fly the spark drone due to the statement provided in the product's disclaimer and safety guidelines.</p>
                        <p>The Civil Aviation Authority is a drone registration company that allows any drone to be registered simply by going to their registration webpage (<a href="https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/individual">https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/individual</a>) you can apply for a test and order a flyer ID for the price of £0 (This ID is only valid for 5 years, a renewal is needed after the expiration date).</p>
                        <h3 class="HeadingBolt">2. Safety precautions</h3>
                        <p>Where you fly the drone is important this is as it could harm the people or property around you therefore you will need to fly it within safe environments. DJI themselves listed safety precautions that will need to be followed to prevent such risks although the spark drone has inbuilt sensors that help with avoiding obstacles in its way and some other safety features there is still a small chance that the drone could malfunction and put anyone around it at risk. You should:</p>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Always fly within areas distant away from obstacles such as magnetic or radio interference, and buildings.</li>
                            <li>Not fly within or near crowds.</li>
                            <li>Not let the drone in an environment with an altitude of 120m high.</li>
                            <li>Not hover the drone 4000m+ above sea level.</li>
                            <li>Fly in appropriate temperatures between 32 degrees to 104 degrees.</li>
                            <li>Be cautious about where you fly it indoors.</li>
